## Object oriented programming

Object oriented programming, commonly referred as OOP, is one of key concepts
in modern programming. This text defines main ideas of OOP.

**OOP** -- programming that consists of defining objects and interacting with
them.

**Object** -- a collection of variables and functions, which represent real
entities.

**Class** -- a container which has all characteristics of an object. An example,
class *dog* has dog *characteristic* `breed` and `color` and *attributes* like
`run` and `walk`.

**Method** -- a function inside a class, which performs a specific task. There
are **2** types of methods: user-defined methods and special methods. A user can
define methods to perform specific actions. Special methods already exist in 
`python`.
